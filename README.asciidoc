libvimregex
-----------

C library providing Vim's flavour of regex - Vim Everywhere!

Architecture
~~~~~~~~~~~~

libvimregex uses Ford's peg/leg parser generator to convert Vim flavoured
regexes into ruby-flavoured regexes which are then evaluated by the oniguruma
regular expressiono engine.

Status
~~~~~~

Achieved simple proof of concept of all required parts.

The code should be looked at in that light - it is *not* clean or well designed.
It is indeed... goatse. Some ugly shorthands have been made in the knowledge
that no matter how well *I* wrote the code, it wouldn't be what the standards
required.

Pending cleanup by one of our C fairies. (Hint! mhi^ :-) )

Vendor
~~~~~~

The Makefile links against two libraries in the vendor tree:

* Oniguruma 5.9.2
* Peg 0.1.7
